This may seem a little bit excessive at first, especially if you plan to use it again tomorrow. You are
probably wondering whether you really need to clean your diffuser every single time.
<br><br>However, regularly cleaning your diffuser is essential for its efficient operation. If you don’t clean
your diffuser according to the manufacturer instructions, you may find that your diffuser doesn’t
work as efficiently, and its performance will begin to decline.
<br><br>After each use, you should empty any remaining water and essential oils from the diffuser, wipe it
with a clean cloth and ensure that it is thoroughly dry before replacing the lid and storing your
diffuser. Once a month, you’ll need to give your diffuser a deep clean. This can be done either with
or without vinegar, depending on your personal preferences.
<br><br>So, after each use of your diffuser, be sure to fully empty it of all water and oil and give it a good
clean.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-fHeRUh ixLxDV pf-61_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-evcjhq leJfDA"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-62_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-63_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-64_ pf-r pf-c-cm" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-65_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-66_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-67_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bTfYFJ iRKxGS pf-68_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-70_">The benefits of diffuser maintenance<br></span></h3><div data-pf-type="Block" class="sc-bXTejn glsbck pf-71_"><p class="sc-uojGG ctGoIP pf-72_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-74_">It can be easy to forget to clean your diffuser, especially if you use it regularly. It might seem like a
tedious, unnecessary task, especially if you’re using it every day.
<br><br>However, it is important to clean your diffuser after every use to keep it in the best possible
condition. This will help to prevent blockages within the diffuser as well as ensure that the aroma of
your oils remains pure.
<br><br>Here are three definitive reasons to properly maintain your essential oil diffuser:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Prevent corrosion of diffuser
</span><br>Certain essential oils such as lemongrass, citronella and oregano oil can be corrosive due to their
high levels of acidity. If you leave them sitting in your diffuser after use, they can damage the
diffuser. Emptying and cleaning your diffuser after every use will help to prevent corrosion, keeping
your diffuser in full working order.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Prolong diffuser lifespan
</span><br>It goes without saying that if you look after your diffuser, it will be less prone to breakdowns. This is
because essential oils can quickly build up, causing blockages within the mechanisms of the diffuser.

That’s why properly maintaining your diffuser according to the manufacturer’s instructions is so
essential for prolonging the life of your diffuser.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Improve aroma of essential oils
</span><br>Essential oils have a high viscosity, especially oils such as patchouli, rose, camomile and sandalwood.
These oils are prone to leaving behind residue within your diffuser, even if you empty and refill it.
These leftover residues will affect the scent of the next oil you diffuse, potentially impacting the
benefits that you receive from that scent. For example, if you are diffusing relaxing lavender oil that
is tainted by leftover uplifting grapefruit oil, it could make it more difficult for you to relax.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-fHeRUh ixLxDV pf-75_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-evcjhq leJfDA"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-76_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-77_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-78_ pf-r pf-c-cm" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-79_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-80_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-81_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bTfYFJ iRKxGS pf-82_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-84_">Top tips for keeping your diffuser healthy<br></span></h3><div data-pf-type="Block" class="sc-bXTejn glsbck pf-85_"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-181582ee--MG5447.jpg?v=1627317335" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-181582ee--MG5447.jpg?v=1627317335 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-181582ee--MG5447_500x.jpg?v=1627317335 320w" width="640" height="427" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-cZMNgc fhouYJ pf-86_"/><p class="sc-uojGG ctGoIP pf-87_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-89_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here are some of our top tips for getting the most out of your diffuser.</span><br>
<br>● Don’t overfill your diffuser with water. If you exceed the maximum fill line, your diffuser
could overheat.<br>
<br>● Try to use distilled or purified water in your diffuser wherever possible. Tap water contains
minerals that could build up in your diffuser, damaging the internal mechanisms.<br>
<br>● Only use pure essential oils, avoiding any additives or fillers. These can build up in your
diffuser, causing long-term damage.<br>
<br>● Be sure to keep exterior buttons and air vents dry when emptying and filling the diffuser, as
well as during the cleaning process.<br>
<br>● Avoid leaving water sitting in your diffuser for long periods of time. This can cause bacteria
to grow, damaging your diffuser.<br>
<br>● Keep away from abrasive cleaners and solvents. Stick to natural products such as essential
oils, distilled water and pure white vinegar.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-fHeRUh ixLxDV pf-90_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-evcjhq leJfDA"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-91_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-92_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-93_ pf-r pf-c-cm" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-94_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-95_ pf-r pf-c-cm" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-96_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-97_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-98_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bTfYFJ iRKxGS pf-99_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-101_">How to clean a diffuser with vinegar step-by-step<br></span></h3><p class="sc-uojGG ctGoIP pf-102_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-104_">We have already discussed why it is important to clean your essential oil diffuser regularly. But how
exactly do you clean a diffuser? The most effective way to clean a diffuser is with vinegar. However,
it’s important to ensure that you choose pure white vinegar for this.
<br><br>Follow the simple steps below to clean your diffuser with vinegar.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Unplug and empty diffuser
</span><br>First things first, make sure that you unplug your diffuser before you begin the cleaning process. Not
only will this avoid any damage to your diffuser, but it will also help to keep you safe too. You’ll also
need to empty it of any leftover water or essential oil that may remain in the reservoir.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Fill with water and vinegar solution
</span><br>Next, add distilled water to your diffuser reservoir until it is around halfway full. Ensure that you
don’t reach the max fill line in this step to avoid damage to your diffuser. Then, add ten drops of
pure white vinegar to the reservoir. Whilst water is sufficient to remove particles from the interior,
vinegar will help to remove any oil residue that remains on the walls.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Run your diffuser
</span><br>Plug in your diffuser, turn it on and allow it to run for up to five minutes. This will allow the water
and vinegar solution to flow through the diffuser and clear any residual oil from the internal
mechanisms.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Drain diffuser
</span><br>
After the cleaning solution has been running through the diffuser for around five minutes, turn off
the diffuser and unplug it. You can then drain the cleaning solution from the diffuser, leaving it
empty.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Clean residue
</span><br>If your diffuser came with a cleaning brush, this is where you’ll use it. Otherwise, a clean cotton
swab can also be effective. Take your cleaning brush or cotton swab and dip it into pure white
vinegar. This will help you to cut through any oil deposits that may still be lingering on your diffuser.
Use the swab to clean the corners and tight spots within the diffuser, ensuring that all oil is removed.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Rinse and dry diffuse</span>r
<br>Now that any residual oil has been removed from the diffuser, it’s time to wash away the vinegar. To
do this, add distilled water to your diffuser and allow it to run through the diffuser for a few
minutes. This will remove the vinegar, leaving your diffuser clean and fresh.
You can then use a microfibre cloth to carefully dry your diffuser. Alternatively, you can allow your
diffuser to air dry. Whichever method you choose, it’s important to ensure that your diffuser is fully
dry before replacing the cover for storage.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">7. Clean cover
</span><br>Finally, you can move onto cleaning the exterior cover of your diffuser. It’s important to follow the
manufacturer’s instructions here, as how you will clean the cover will depend on the material it is
made from. For some diffusers, cleaning the exterior cover with a damp cloth will be sufficient,
whilst others may permit a small amount of dishwashing detergent.<br></span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-16181582--MG5112.jpg?v=1627313406" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-16181582--MG5112.jpg?v=1627313406 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-16181582--MG5112_500x.jpg?v=1627313406 320w" width="640" height="427" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-cZMNgc fhouYJ pf-105_"/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-fHeRUh ixLxDV pf-106_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-evcjhq leJfDA"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-107_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-108_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-109_ pf-r pf-c-cm" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-110_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-111_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-112_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bTfYFJ iRKxGS pf-113_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-115_">How to clean oil diffuser without vinegar<br></span></h3><p class="sc-uojGG ctGoIP pf-116_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-118_">If you prefer to avoid using vinegar to clean your diffuser, there is another effective option. To follow
this method, you’ll need a cotton swab, rubbing alcohol and a clean microfibre cloth.
<br><br>Here are the simple steps to follow for cleaning your essential oil diffuser without vinegar.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Unplug and empty diffuser
</span><br>Begin by unplugging your diffuser from the power supply and emptying any water and oil that
remain in the reservoir.
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>2. Wipe the reservoir
</span><br>Next, use a clean microfibre cloth to wipe around the inside of the diffuser reservoir, removing any
remaining water and essential oils. After completing this step, the reservoir should be dry.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Clean away any residue
</span><br>Then, take a clean cotton swab or the cleaning brush that came with your diffuser and dip it in
rubbing alcohol or orange essential oil. Use the cotton swab to clean the interior of your diffuser,
including the fan inlet and the ultrasonic plate. This should remove all traces of any leftover essential
oils.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Run your diffuser
</span><br>Next, top up your diffuser with distilled water and allow it to run for a few minutes. This will ensure
that the rubbing alcohol is removed from your diffuser. After a few minutes, switch off the diffuser
and empty out the remaining water.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Clean diffuser cover
</span><br>&nbsp;Finally, clean the exterior cover of your diffuser. You’ll need to follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for this, as different materials will require different cleaning techniques. Some diffusers
will require you to only use a damp cloth, whilst others may permit a small amount of dishwashing
detergent.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-fHeRUh ixLxDV pf-119_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-evcjhq leJfDA"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-120_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-121_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-122_ pf-r pf-c-cm" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-123_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-124_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-125_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bTfYFJ iRKxGS pf-126_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-128_">Troubleshooting your diffuser<br></span></h3><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-c6b81618--MG5287-Edited?v=1627313179" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-cZMNgc fhouYJ pf-129_"/><p class="sc-uojGG ctGoIP pf-130_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-132_">Despite regular maintenance, sometimes you might find that your diffuser runs into problems or
begins to operate below maximum efficiency. Cleaning is often the answer, but sometimes this
might not solve the problem.
<br><br>Here are some of the most common issues that people experience with diffusers, along with
actionable steps you can take to resolve them.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Diffuser won’t power on
</span><br>If your diffuser won’t power on, there are a few things you’ll need to check. Firstly, ensure that the
power plug is connected to the electrical outlet and that the outlet is turned on. Then, ensure that
the power supply is plugged into the diffuser itself.
<br><br>You will also need to ensure that the reservoir contains the right amount of water, not exceeding the
maximum fill line. If your diffuser still won’t power on, turn it off, empty it and wait a few days for it
to fully dry out before trying again. This will enable any internal components the chance to dry out if
they have become wet during cleaning or regular use.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Water overheats in diffuser
</span><br>The most common cause of water overheating in a diffuser is often that it has been overfilled with
water. If this is the case, you will need to turn off and unplug the diffuser from the power supply
before emptying the water. Leave the diffuser to cool down completely before refilling to the correct
level and trying again. If the diffuser won’t start after being emptied and cooled, it is likely to have
been damaged by overfilling and will require repair or replacement.
<br><br>If you find that the water in your diffuser is overheating without being overfilled, it’s likely that there
is a problem with the fan intake. Ensure that the fan isn’t being obstructed by a towel or cloth and
look for any hairs that may be stuck in it. Unplug the diffuser and allow it to cool before refilling and
restarting.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Poor diffusion
</span><br>If your diffuser is not as powerful as usual, or there is very little diffusion, there are a few things you
will need to check. First, ensure there is enough water in your diffuser. If the water level is too low, it
may be unable to operate. If there is enough water in your diffuser, the fan inlet may be blocked by
dried essential oils. Try cleaning your diffuser with a clean cotton swab, then run a solution of
distilled water and a few drops of pure white vinegar through your diffuser to clean the inlet and
clear the blockage.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Indicator light flashes but diffuser does not start
</span><br>If your diffuser doesn’t start despite the indicator light flashing, it’s likely that a fault has been
detected or that the diffuser has malfunctioned. Unplug the diffuser, empty the water from the
reservoir and allow it to cool down. When it has fully cooled, refill the reservoir and restart the
diffuser. If the diffuser still fails to start, it will need to be professionally repaired or replaced.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-fHeRUh ixLxDV pf-133_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-evcjhq leJfDA"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-134_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-135_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-136_ pf-r pf-c-cm" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-137_"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-138_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-139_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bTfYFJ iRKxGS pf-140_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-142_">To sum up<br></span></h3><p class="sc-uojGG ctGoIP pf-143_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-cbTzjv cciAhs pf-145_">Essential oil diffusers serve a multitude of purposes, from invoking a sense of relaxation and calm to
setting a particular atmosphere for guests to boosting your energy and giving you the motivation to
get the most out of life. However, to achieve the maximum lifespan out of your diffuser, a little
effort goes a long way in maintaining and cleaning your diffuser.
<br><br>It’s always best to read the manufacturer’s instruction manual that came with your diffuser to
ensure that you’re following the best practices for your individual diffuser. This includes cleaning
your diffuser after each use and ensuring that you follow the instructions carefully to prevent
damage from occurring.
<br><br>Maintaining diffusers can be annoying and time-consuming, but it can help to prevent costly damage
from occurring and prolong the life of your essential oil diffuser. With a little TLC and some regular
maintenance, diffusers can offer you many years of delightful aromas and relaxing scents for your
home.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-fHeRUh ixLxDV pf-146_  blogfooter"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-evcjhq leJfDA"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-147_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-148_"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-kHOZwM gGGBsj pf-149_">{% render 'trustpilot-review' %}</div></div></div></div><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-150_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-151_"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-kHOZwM gGGBsj pf-152_">{% render 'trustpilot-review-slider' %}</div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-fHeRUh ixLxDV pf-153_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-evcjhq leJfDA"><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-154_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-ctqQKy imxmpH pf-155_"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-kHOZwM gGGBsj pf-156_">{% render 'related-blog-post' %}</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>window.__pagefly_setting__={"baseURL":"https://apps.pagefly.io","analyticsURL":"https://analytics.pagefly.io","isBackend":false,"cdnURL":"https://cdn.pagefly.io","pageflyVersion":"3.15.1","shopDomain":"volantaromaeuro.myshopify.com","elementData":{},"pageTitle":"The best-kept secrets for maintaining your diffuser","pageType":"blog","pageId":"cfc74fc7-b0fa-40d4-bb19-8b8706ea2b68","lazyLoad":false,"forceByPassGoogleLightHouse":false,"imageLazyLoad":false,"nativeImageLazyLoad":true,"useThemeJQ":false,"selectedFonts":{"Barlow":{"400":0,"600":0},"Montserrat":{"400":0,"600":0}},"trackingIDs":[],"shopifyProxyPath":"/a/pf_preview"};window.__pagefly_setting__.moneyFormat={{shop.money_format|json}};</script><script src="https://cdn.pagefly.io/pagefly/3.15.1/core/helper.js" async></script> </article>
