Are you confused yet? To be categorised as an oil, a substance needs to contain fatty acids, which essential oils do not contain. So, if they aren’t classed as oils, what exactly are essential oils? <br><br>
Essential oils are highly concentrated, volatile (meaning they evaporate quickly) compounds that are extracted from plants. The substance that is extracted contains potent medicinal and cosmetic properties, as well as having a strong aroma. <br><br>
You might be wondering how an essential oil is extracted from a plant. This process can be done in one of two ways: through distillation or mechanical methods. Whichever method is selected, this remains a delicate and fragile process which must be done carefully to retain the unique properties and qualities of the plant. <br><br>
Most essential oils are extracted through low-pressure steam distillation. This delicate process involves passing steam through a vat which is filled with the desired plant, seed, flower or wood. The steam becomes enriched with the essential oil, carrying it into a coil where it condenses back into a liquid. The essential oil is then extracted from the water and bottled. <br><br>
Another popular method of extracting essential oils is through cold pressing. This method is mainly used in <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://volantaroma.com/products/citrus-boost" target="_self">citrus oils&nbsp;</a></span>such as orange, lemon, and <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://volantaroma.com/products/grapefruit-essential-oil" target="_self">grapefruit oil</a></span>. The fruit is passed over rasping cylinders that puncture the outermost layer of the fruit’s rind. This causes the sacs which contain essential oil to burst open. Water is then sprayed over the fruit to collect the leaking essential oil, after which the essential oil can be carefully separated from the water to be bottled.

The truth is, essential oils aren’t a new phenomenon. In fact, the use of essential oils can actually be traced back over 6,000 years, with the Greeks, Egyptians, Romans and Chinese all benefitting from the therapeutic qualities of essential oils over the millennia. <br><br>
For example, as far back as 3,500 BC, the Ancient Egyptians were using essential oils and plant extracts for medicinal purposes, as well as for cosmetics and religious rituals. <br><br>
In the millennia that followed, the power of essential oils spread across the globe, with rumours circulating that essential oils could be the natural cure to many ailments. By 400 BC, the Ancient Greeks had also realised the benefits of essential oils. In fact, Hippocrates, one of the most well-known doctors of this period, famously used essential oils in the treatment of his patients. <br><br>
Fast forward to 1910 and you’ll find French perfumer and chemist Rene Maurice Gattefosse discovering that the body is able to absorb small amounts of essential oils, interacting with the body’s chemistry. In fact, it was during this year that Rene Maurice Gattefosse used lavender oil to successfully treat a burn on his hand. <br><br>
By the 1950s, massage therapists had begun to routinely use essential oils as a complementary therapy, enhancing <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://volantaroma.com/blogs/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-aromatherapy-massage" target="_self">massage therapy</a></span>&nbsp;and offering clients a wide range of holistic benefits. Since this time, essential oils have become a key part of holistic and alternative health treatments, used by people across the globe for enhancing their wellbeing and easing a wide range of different ailments and health conditions.

This means that most essential oils can be kept for several years, giving you impressive value for money. However, it’s important to note that essential oils can oxidise and deteriorate over time, meaning that they will gradually lose their potency, therapeutic benefits and aromatic qualities. <br><br>
The shelf life of your favourite essential oil will be dependent on many different factors including the quality of the plant, how the plant was harvested, how the essential oil was extracted, the handling of the oil, and how the oil is stored. <br><br>
However, you can estimate the shelf life of an essential oil based on its chemical properties. For example, essential oils from the sesquiterpene family such as patchouli, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://volantaroma.com/collections/ylang-ylang" target="_self">ylang-ylang</a></span>&nbsp;and <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://volantaroma.com/collections/roman-chamomile/relaxing" target="_self">German chamomile</a></span>&nbsp;have a shelf life of around 8 – 10 years, whilst monoterpenols such as lavender, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://volantaroma.com/products/peppermint-essential-oil" target="_self">peppermint</a>&nbsp;</span>and geranium will last for around 5 – 6 years. <br><br>
Essential oils which belong to the monoterpene family which include citrus oils such as lemon, grapefruit and sweet orange, as well as oils such as frankincense and cypress, have a considerably shorter shelf life of 2 – 3 years. This reduced shelf life is a result of the oils being unsaturated which makes them more prone to oxidation.<br><br> 
You can give your essential oils the best chance of achieving a long shelf life by keeping them in a dark glass bottle to protect them from light. They should be stored in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.

That’s what makes essential oils so potent. <br><br>
To give you an idea of the quantity of plant that goes into essential oils, here are some examples of the amount of plant that is needed to produce various oils:
<br><br>● It takes around two pounds of lavender flowers to produce a 10 ml bottle of lavender essential oil.
<br><br>● One lemon contains five drops of lemon essential oil. That means that around 34 lemons go into each 10 ml bottle of lemon essential oil. <br><br>● You’d need over 5 pounds of peppermint leaves to create a 10 ml bottle of peppermint essential oil. In fact, 28 cups of peppermint tea is equivalent to just one drop of <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://volantaroma.com/products/peppermint-essential-oil" target="_self">peppermint essential oil</a>.</span><br><br>● To produce a 10 ml bottle of rose essential oil, you’d need almost 500,000 rose petals. <br><br>
As essential oils are extremely potent, it’s important to remember that only a tiny quantity is needed to induce powerful effects on your body. When you use essential oils, it’s always a good idea to start with a single drop and increase the quantity if required. That way, you will never have to worry about wasting your precious essential oils and it’ll help to avoid any unwanted effects from overuse.

Concentration boosting essential oils include lemon, peppermint, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://volantaroma.com/products/organic-rosemary-essential-oil" target="_self">rosemary</a></span>, and sweet orange. These essential oils can help to give you motivation and enhance your productivity when you need it the most. <br><br>

<br>● Enhanced relaxation – opt for oils such as lavender, ylang-ylang, and rose.
