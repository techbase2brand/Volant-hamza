Coconut oil, extracted from the fruit of the coconut tree, is a super-oil full of natural antioxidants and is in itself an excellent antifungal, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial oil. It nourishes the hair, nails and skin. 50% of its content is lauric acid which means that coconut oil has a long shelf life and improves cholesterol levels. Coconut oil is also good for dry skin and other skin problems, as it has natural moisturizing properties.<br> <br>When buying coconut oil, look for unrefined coconut oil, as it has not been recovered by chemical recovery methods. You can buy coconut oil that smells good and is solid at room temperature and works well for making homemade balms and creams. Alternatively, fractionated coconut oil that is liquid at room temperature and has almost no aroma makes a good carrier for essential oils to be used for massage purposes.<br></span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-9b1ddbbf--pfbdc148aanazarhrabovyilIuxlN0zSjsunsplash_500x.jpg?v=1620752733" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-9b1ddbbf--pfbdc148aanazarhrabovyilIuxlN0zSjsunsplash.jpg?v=1620752733 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-9b1ddbbf--pfbdc148aanazarhrabovyilIuxlN0zSjsunsplash_500x.jpg?v=1620752733 320w" width="640" height="427" sizes="(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, (min-width: 1024px) 1280px, (min-width: 640px) 768px, 320px" loading="lazy" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-25_"/><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-gXfVKN hOTIIO pf-26_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-28_">Olive oil<br></span></h3><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-29_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-31_">Olive oil is extracted from the fruit of the olive tree and has many health benefits. With 75% oleic acid, it is a popular cooking oil. It is good for the heart and cardiovascular system, and can actually lower high (LDL) cholesterol and increase the good (HDL) cholesterol. It is also anti-inflammatory and helps reduce insulin resistance.<br> <br>Olive oil is a light oil with a fruity aroma that is not overwhelming. It works well as a mixture with most essential oils. You can use it for almost all skin and hair types, as it does not clog the skin's pores or leave hair looking oily. It counteracts dandruff, frizzy hair and dry skin.<br> <br>Make sure you do not buy the cheapest brands, as these are refined and mixed with other oils in the production process. Unrefined extra virgin olive oil is the best, as no heat or chemicals are used in the extraction process. It also contains the most oleic acid.<br></span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-1ddbbfe4--pfcf07af92chelseashapourir40EYKVyutIunsplash_500x.jpg?v=1620752756" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-1ddbbfe4--pfcf07af92chelseashapourir40EYKVyutIunsplash.jpg?v=1620752756 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9088/4510/t/3/assets/pf-1ddbbfe4--pfcf07af92chelseashapourir40EYKVyutIunsplash_500x.jpg?v=1620752756 320w" width="640" height="427" sizes="(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, (min-width: 1024px) 1280px, (min-width: 640px) 768px, 320px" loading="lazy" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-32_"/><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-gXfVKN hOTIIO pf-33_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-35_">Jojoba oil<br></span></h3><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-36_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-38_">Jojoba oil is known to be the carrier oil that is closest to mimicking the natural oil secretions in human skin.

Jojoba oil is a natural fungicide and works well when combined with essential oils that also have fungicidal properties and are used for local fungal infections.<br> <br>With its ability to resist oxidation, jojoba oil has a long shelf life.

It is one of the thickest, most luxurious oils on our list. Avocado oil is also a good oil to use against signs of ageing, as it contains a type of fatty acid that is found naturally in human fatty tissue just under the skin. Since avocado oil is similar to this fat, the skin absorbs it easily. This provides excellent nourishment for older skin that has thinned with age.<br> <br>Avocado oil contains high concentrations of oleic and linoleic fatty acids, making it a potent anti-inflammatory, along with other natural nutrients and antioxidants such as vitamins A, D and E. This carrier oil is ideal for irritable skin types such as those having psoriasis and eczema.<br> <br>Due to its thickness, avocado oil dries slowly, making it a good carrier oil for massage. To make it more liquid, it can be mixed with another carrier oil such as olive oil or almond oil.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-ckTSus kVjkXt pf-60_ blogfooter"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-gGLxEB dGJRan"><div class="sc-iwajpm kydRHc pf-61_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-oeezt OJJCp pf-62_"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-cBoqAE lRfdj pf-63_">{% render 'trustpilot-review' %}</div></div></div></div><div class="sc-iwajpm kydRHc pf-64_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-oeezt OJJCp pf-65_"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-cBoqAE lRfdj pf-66_">{% render 'trustpilot-review-slider' %}</div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-ckTSus kVjkXt pf-67_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-gGLxEB dGJRan"><div class="sc-iwajpm kydRHc pf-68_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-oeezt OJJCp pf-69_"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-cBoqAE lRfdj pf-70_">{% render 'related-blog-post' %}</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>window.__pagefly_setting__={"baseURL":"https://apps.pagefly.io","analyticsURL":"https://analytics.pagefly.io","isBackend":false,"cdnURL":"https://cdn.pagefly.io","pageflyVersion":"3.7.4","shopDomain":"volantaromaeuro.myshopify.com","elementData":{},"pageTitle":"Carrier oils for essential oils","pageType":"blog","pageId":"78afdb0d-bc5a-4a29-8858-d895c759d616","lazyLoad":false,"forceByPassGoogleLightHouse":false,"imageLazyLoad":true,"nativeImageLazyLoad":true,"useThemeJQ":false,"fontLink":"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Barlow:wght@400;600&family=Montserrat:wght@400;600&display=swap","trackingIDs":[],"shopifyProxyPath":"/a/pf_preview"};window.__pagefly_setting__.moneyFormat={{shop.money_format|json}};</script><script src="https://cdn.pagefly.io/pagefly/3.7.4/core/helper.js" defer></script> </article>{% schema %}
